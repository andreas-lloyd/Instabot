Could try and do some A / B testing to find out what is the best hashtag (for example)
- Maybe enter a post with 50 / 50 and save info about that page to get an idea of how fair everything is?
- Would also need some dummy comments to post, so also use those dummy comments randomly?

General A / B test where we track posts and followers etc -> difficulty is in how to split because would have to do on a post by post basis
- Maybe would need to set some kind of dynamic prior in order to see what the results "should" look like
- Problem also in frequency, but could be a slow learning process

Can we look up a user we want to follow to evaluate?
- Check when last active
- Check how many followers
- This way can keep the ratio more healthy

If have stories - then have connected recently

Maybe strategy could be to comment / like a few times as well as follow to see if get interaction

Check if they have a really bad following / follower ratio > can add to different lists of what to do with them
- In general will have to save names because if not, then will start hitting them again
